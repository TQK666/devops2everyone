## factors that do not guarantee a bot's success
  * how smart the bot is: unlikely that your bot smarter will guarantee happy
  users and adoption of your platform.

  * how much natural language the bot supports:
  your bot can be grate at conversations. but unless it addresses the problems
  that your users need to solve, these capabilities may contribute very little to making your bot successful.

  * voice: forcing users to use voice can result in a frustrating user experience.

## factors that do influence a bot's success

  * does the bot easily solve the user's problem with minimum number of steps ?
  * does bot solve the user's problem better than any of  the alternative experiences?
  * does the bot run on the devices and platforms the user cares about?
  * is the bot discoverable? do the users naturally know what to do when using it?
